# Face-Recognition-as-a-Tool-for-Online-Attendance.

This is our final year computer science engineering project.

We have created a full fledged face recognition app , that is capable of taking students' photos along with their credentials , and train their faces. Which can be later used to recognize.

The functionalities of application :

1. There are 2 UI's : one for platform admin / teacher and the other is for student.
2. Student can register his Name , SRN (Unique Student Role Number) , Gender , Class , Teacher , Subject etc.
3. Student can train the model using his photos and send it to the admin.
4. The admin can validate the student details.
5. The teacher can import/export/edit/delete the attendance sheet.
6. The student can view his attendance sheet.
7. The student details are stored in MongoDB.
8. To maintain fair play , the teacher can set a threshold of 45mins , till which the student has to sit infront of the camera to get his attendance.

The Algorithms used:

1. Face Detection : Haar Cascade Algorithm.
2. Face Recognition : LBPH Algorithm.


P.S : The project is still in development phase , we will upload it once we submit it to the panel.
